st.write("""
The **Pareto Distribution** is a power-law distribution that is commonly used to model the distribution of wealth, income, and other quantities that exhibit a similar skewed behavior. Named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, it is often associated with the **80:20 rule**â€”where approximately 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Power Law**: There is a functional relationship between two quantities, where one quantity varies as a power of the other.
- **Right-Skewed**: Most values are clustered around the lower end, with a few very large values.
- **Heavy Tails**: The Pareto Distribution has a heavy tail, meaning extreme values are more probable compared to other distributions.

The Pareto Distribution is widely used in economics, sociology, and other fields to model phenomena with heavy-tailed distributions. Examples include:
- **Wealth Distribution**: A small percentage of the population controls a large portion of the wealth.
- **City Sizes**: A few cities have very large populations, while most are small.
- **File Sizes on the Internet**: A small number of very large files contribute to a significant portion of total traffic.

This distribution is useful when analyzing scenarios where extreme values are more frequent than in normal distributions.
