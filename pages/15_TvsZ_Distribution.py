st.write("""
The **T-distribution** (Student's T-distribution) and the **Z-distribution** (Standard Normal distribution) are both continuous probability distributions, but they are used in different situations. 

- **Z-distribution (Standard Normal Distribution)** assumes that the population standard deviation is known and follows a normal distribution. 
- **T-distribution** is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small. The shape of the T-distribution depends on the **degrees of freedom (df)**, and it gets closer to the Z-distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.

Let's compare them by adjusting the degrees of freedom using the slider below.

st.write("""
- The **Z-distribution** is symmetrical and follows the standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- The **T-distribution** is also symmetrical but has heavier tails than the Z-distribution, meaning it gives more probability to extreme values. This is especially true for small degrees of freedom.
- As the **degrees of freedom** increase, the T-distribution approaches the Z-distribution.

T-distribution is widely used in **hypothesis testing** and **confidence intervals** when working with small samples and unknown population standard deviations.
