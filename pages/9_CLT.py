st.write("""
The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is one of the fundamental theorems in statistics. It states that the distribution of the 
sample means (averages) of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables 
approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. This property holds true 
as long as the sample size is sufficiently large, typically \(n â‰¥ 30\).
""")

st.subheader("Why is the CLT Important?")
st.write("""
The CLT is the cornerstone of many statistical methods. It allows us to:
- **Make inferences about population means** from sample data.
- **Construct confidence intervals** and perform hypothesis tests.
- Justify the use of the normal distribution in many scenarios, even when the data is not normally distributed.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Regardless of the original population distribution**, the distribution of the sample means tends to become normal as the sample size increases.
- **Larger sample sizes** lead to sample means that are more closely clustered around the true population mean, reducing the spread (standard error).
- The CLT provides a theoretical foundation for many statistical techniques, making it possible to use normal distribution-based methods in a wide range of applications.

st.info("Try changing the population distribution and see how the shape of the sample means distribution becomes more normal as the sample size increases.")

st.write("""
### Real-World Applications of CLT:
- **Quality Control**: Understanding the distribution of product dimensions, lifetimes, or error rates.
- **Finance**: Estimating the average return on investments over time.
- **Biostatistics**: Modeling the average response to a treatment in clinical trials.
- **Machine Learning**: 
    - **Model Evaluation**: Using the CLT to understand the distribution of performance metrics across different training runs or validation sets.
    - **Confidence Intervals for Predictions**: Constructing confidence intervals around predictions made by machine learning models to gauge their reliability.
    - **Assumption Testing**: Validating assumptions of normality in residuals of regression models.
