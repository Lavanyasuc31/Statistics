## 🚀 **What’s Inside?**

This app is designed to guide you through fundamental topics in statistics, ranging from probability distributions to hypothesis testing, all with hands-on features and visual aids to solidify your learning. Here’s what you can expect:

### 🌟 **Key Features**:
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Adjust parameters like probability and degrees of freedom to see how distributions change in real-time.
- **Explainers**: Get easy-to-understand explanations of complex statistical terms and formulas.
- **Confidence Interval Explorer**: Visualize confidence intervals with candlestick plots for hands-on learning.
- **Z-tests and T-tests**: Perform hypothesis testing with interactive input options to explore one-sample and two-sample tests.
- **Chi-Square Tests**: Dive into Chi-Square Goodness of Fit and Independence tests with input fields for observed and expected values.

---

## 📚 **Topics Covered**

Here’s a peek into the main statistical topics you’ll explore:

1. **Probability Distributions**:
    - **Bernoulli Distribution**: Adjust the probability of success and visualize PMF and CDF.
    - **Poisson Distribution**: Explore rare event probabilities with λ (rate of occurrence).
    - **T-distribution vs Z-distribution**: Compare distributions and adjust degrees of freedom.
    
2. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**:
    - Understand how sample means converge to a normal distribution as sample size increases.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
    - **Null and Alternative Hypotheses**: Learn the key concepts.
    - **One-sided vs Two-sided Tests**: See the differences in critical regions.
    - **Type I and Type II Errors**: Visualize and understand the errors in hypothesis testing.

4. **Chi-Square Tests**:
    - Test for independence and goodness of fit with customizable input values.

5. **Confidence Intervals**:
    - Use candlestick plots to see how different confidence levels affect interval estimation.
